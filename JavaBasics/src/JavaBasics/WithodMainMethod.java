Yes, we can execute a java program without a main method by using a static block. 

Static block in Java is a group of statements that gets executed 
only once when the class is loaded into the memory by Java ClassLoader,
It is also known as a static initialization block.
Static initialization block is going directly into the stack memory.

Example
class StaticInitializationBlock{
   static{
      System.out.println("class without a main method");
      System.exit(0);
   }
}
In the above example, 
we can execute a java program without a main method (works until Java 1.6 version). 
Java 7 and newer versions don’t allow this because 
JVM checks the presence of the main method before initializing the class.
